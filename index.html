        <h2>Website</h2>

      <h2 ><span class="x12">Error</span> Handling</h2>
      <p class="mb">If the program doesn't run:  </p>
          <p>1. Disable Antivirus <span class="highlights">or</span> <br>Add file as exception to Antivirus (common issue)</p>
          <p>2. Run as administrator
          (properties -&gt; advanced -&gt; run as admin.
          This automation eliminates the need for manual intervention)</p>
          <p>3. Restart (optional)</p>
          <br>
      <h2 >Precautions/Before Running</h2>
      <p>Use an adblocker - <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=de" target="_blank">Ublock Origin</a></p>

      <h2 >Understanding Capabilities</h2>
      <p>Consoleflix provides access to over 20,000 shows.</p>
      <p>It automatically opens and plays the link in your browser.</p>
      <p>The loading time for the link may vary from 1.8 to 3 seconds.</p>
      <p>Not every Movie/Show will work, some players may be broken.</p>
      <p>If Movie/Show is new -> english, else -> mostly german</p>

      <br>

      <h2 >Format for Accessing Shows</h2>
      <p>Specify the show, season, and episode using the format: <br>"<em>ShowName, Season, Episode</em>".</p>
      <p>Note that ShowNames might differ slightly from the original names, such as using hyphens or omitting spaces. For example, "The Simpsons" becomes "simpsons", "Family Guy" becomes "family-guy", etc.</p>
      <br>

      <h2>For Movies</h2>
      <p>Given format: <br>"<em>movieName</em>".</p>
 <p><em>movieName</em> uses the <a>german title</a> of the movie.</p>
      <p>Note that movieName might differ slightly from the original name, which you get from googling, such as using hyphens or omitting spaces. <br>For example, "spider-man 3" becomes "spider-man-3", "challengers: rivalen
" becomes "challengers-rivalen", etc.</p>
      <p>Occasionally the movieName can differ a lot more than just having hyphens,<br>so Try & Error won't work, in that case: <a href="#findingMovieNames">[Finding Movie Names]</a> </p>
<br>

      <h2>Button Functionalities</h2>
      <p><span class="key2"><</span> - Alt + < | Previous Episode</p>
      <p><span class="key2">></span> - Alt + > | Next Episode</p>
        <p><span class="key2"> Show/Movies</span> - (<em>Shows</em> by Default) input will take show format. On press it changes to Movies and takes movieName as input.</p>
      <p><span class="key2"> Get Video</span> - pauses player, then Opens browser with given Episode</p>
      <p><span class="key2">AutoShort</span> - When On, will open the next Episode in the browser automatically for every 20 Minutes</p>
      <p><span class="key2">AutoLong</span> - Same as AutoShort but for 40 Minutes</p>
      <p><span class="key2">Fullscreen</span> - Alt + F | (On by default)<br> When On, will open & play Episode in Fullscreen automatically</p>
      <br>

        <h2 >Finding Show Names</h2>
      <p class="mb">You have two options:</p>
      <p class="mb"><strong>Option a)</strong> Guessing by trial and error, considering that most shows with spaces either use hyphens or no spaces at all.</p>
      <p><strong>Option b)</strong> Using an external website where you can search <a href="http://186.2.175.5/search" target="_blank">http://186.2.175.5/search</a> for the show, click on it, and find the name in the URL.</p>
      <br>

      <h2 >Examples of Show Names</h2>
      <p>Examples include "simpsons", "family-guy", "southpark",
         "icarly", "disneys-american-dragon", "cyberpunk-edgerunners", etc.</p>
      <br>

<h2 id="findingMovieNames">Finding Movie Names</h2>
      <p class="mb">You have a few options:</p>
      <p class="mb"><strong>Option a)</strong> Try & Error, same as a) from shows but this time the names being used are the <a>german</a> ones instead the original,<br>so it can differ much more, so this is way harder.</p>
        <p><strong>Option b)</strong> <a href="https://filmpalast.to/" target="_blank">https://filmpalast.to/</a> for the movie, click/search it and find the name in the URL.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Example: How to get movieName from URL?</h2>
        <p> <strong>URL:</strong><em> https://filmpalast.to/stream/spider-man-no-way-home</em><br>-> you will need this part as the movieName: <a>spider-man-no-way-home</a> </p>
      <br>

        <h2 >Examples of Movie Names</h2>
      <p>Examples include "the-fall-guy", "spider-man", "avengers-3-infinity-war",
         "spider-man-no-way-home", "john-wick-kapitel-3", "creed-3-rockys-legacy", etc.</p>
      <br>
